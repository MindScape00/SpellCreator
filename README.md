# Spell Creator - AKA: Arcanum - The Spell Forge
World of Warcraft Addon designed for use on Epislon WoW for creating combinations of timed actions (spells, auras, animations, etc) to create a custom 'spell'.

## Installation
Drag the "SpellCreator" addon to your Epsilon/\_retail_/Interface/Addons/ folder.
Launch the game, and login. In bottom left of Character Select, click "Addons" and then ensure 'Arcanum - Spell Forge' is enabled. Use "/arcanum", "/sf" or click on the button on the MiniMap once ingame to show the GUI. (Can be dragged around to reposition anywhere around the minimap).
